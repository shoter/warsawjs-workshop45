# Result of workshop for WarsawJS

This repository contains simple library which provides methods for dealing with arrays in immutable way.

## Immutability

I decided to go with immutable arguments because:

- It is easier to understand code this way
- Writing unit tests is easier
- Code that uses immutable practices will be less error prone.
